## Description
This game is a project done during an internship at EyeCueLab. In this multiplayer, real-time game, users create a team, set various campaign variables (such as a daily step goal and a campaign length) and survive this apocalytic wasteland by making it to safehouses. Each day, users must complete the alloted daily step goal, otherwise the whole team has to go back to the previous safe house! Users encounter random events, not limited to zombie attacks, searchable buildings, and the occasional undead programmer--all while keeping track of your daily steps.
